# DPNEGF

**DPNEGF** is a Python package that integrates the Deep Learning Tight-Binding (**DeePTB**) approach with the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (**NEGF**) method, establishing an efficient quantum transport simulation framework **DeePTB-NEGF** with first-principles accuracy. 

By using DeePTB-SK or DeePTB-E3—both available within the DeePTB package—DeePTB-NEGF can compute quantum transport properties in open-boundary systems with either environment-corrected **Slater-Koster TB Hamiltonian** or **linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian**.

## Installation

Installing **DPNEGF** is straightforward. We recommend using a virtual environment for dependency management.

- **Requirements**
  - Git
  - DeePTB(https://github.com/deepmodeling/DeePTB) ≥ 2.1.1

- **From Source**
    1. Clone the repository:
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/DeePTB-Lab/dpnegf.git
        ```
    2. Navigate to the root directory and install DPNEGF:
        ```bash
        cd dpnegf
        pip install .
        ```
## Test code 

To ensure the code is correctly installed, please run the unit tests first:
```bash
pytest ./dpnegf/tests/
```
Be careful if not all tests pass!
