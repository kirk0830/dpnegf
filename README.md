# DeePTB-NEGF

**DeePTB-NEGF** is a Python package that integrates the Deep Learning Tight-Binding (**DeePTB**) approach with the Non-Equilibrium Green’s Function (**NEGF**) method, enabling efficient quantum transport simulations with first-principles accuracy. 

By using DeePTB-SK or DeePTB-E3—both available within the DeePTB package—DeePTB-NEGF can compute quantum transport properties in open-boundary systems with either **Slater-Koster tight-binding Hamiltonian** with first-principles accuracy or **linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian**.
